The Department of Computer Science, University of Kerala has been doing active research in Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, and AI related modules. The M. Sc. Computer Science (with specialization in Artificial Intelligence) Programme intends to provide specialist skills in artificial intelligence, opening the door to a range of careers for students. Students will develop strong theoretical and technical knowledge and skills including a thorough grounding in machine learning and specialist skills in artificial intelligence, which will provide the directly transferable skills for a career in the field of AI. AI plays a major role in shaping the future education. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to have enormous impact in addressing many of the greatest societal challenges that face us today, e.g. ageing, transport, and the environment. It is expected that it will help improve the quality of life of citizens both at home and at work. In addition, it will contribute greatly to increasing industrial competitiveness across all sectors, including small and medium-sized enterprises and non-tech industries. India is developing to be a leading edge in AI and robotics. This strong expertise is also reflected in the level of investment in India from world leading companies, either in existing labs or companies, or in creating new major R&D labs. In addition, India has a exciting start-up landscape. However, these AI resources are scattered throughout India. Therefore, in order to fully exploit the potential of AI for the benefit of the society and to guarantee India's leading position in AI, it is essential to start the courses that will create an impact on the society and industry requirements. The deep investigation into state-of-the-art technologies, concepts and theories, supported by a thriving active research projects are done as part of this programme. Topics studied will include Machine Learning, AI concepts, Data Analytics and interdisciplinary areas such as block chain, Agent technology, deep learning. The students should be able to develop specialist knowledge and experience in the development of Artificial Intelligent Systems and solve and automate the projects/ case studies based on Machine Learning and AI research.\",\n '1. The purpose is to develop a work force which can step up to the challenges of the upcoming age of artificial intelligence. 2. Towards this end, the CS department feels the need to create a focused masters specialization along the theme.']"
