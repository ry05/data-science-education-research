https://catalog.upenn.edu/graduate/programs/social-policy-data-analytics-mssp/,Economics for Social Policy,"Economics allows us to determine the costs and benefits of social policies like cash benefits, unemployment insurance, health insurance, pensions, education, etc. Policies typically affect the behavior of agents like individuals, families and firms, and we have to take these reactions into account when analyzing policy. Economics allows us to predict how policy is likely to affect behavior by understanding how the policy changes individuals' decisions, and what collective outcomes these myriad individual decisions bring about. For example, a universal basic income allows individuals to sustain themselves and their families when they are not working. At the same time, such guaranteed income has the potential to discourage people from looking for a job. If enough people are discouraged from looking for a job, employment in the economy will decrease, leading to lower production and lower tax revenues for the government. Policy makers have to take these phenomena into account in order to design a good income support system.",

https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/,Introduction to Data Management for Business Intelligence,"The course provides a foundation for coupling the analytics and decision-making with the contexts of the V’s of Big Data. Specifically, it will tackle the trade-offs between data properties and the tools/techniques to optimize the generation of information/knowledge, under the impacts of Volume, Velocity and Variety. The students will gain both:

Foundational knowledge: what is the impact of the data properties on the choice of its representation and what does that entail in terms of operations over the data?  and
Hands-on knowledge: what are the corresponding technologies (and the main differences among them) that enable querying the data under a particular representation model?
The course has the following major units:

U1: (Volume) Data Warehousing – how to ask analytical queries over huge datasets that are generated via integration from traditional databases as sources.

U2: (Velocity) Streaming Data – what are the constraints that arise when the rate of arrival of data is faster (and the volume larger) than can be stored in the memory? What does it mean to query such data?

U3: (Variety) Graph Databases – although, in theory, one could use relational databases, why is it that a large volumes of data of practical interest are better off represented under a different model? What are the operators over such model and how are the queries constructed/processed?

U4: (Potpourri) – example: Time Series data: what is the impact of a large volumes of such data? How does one reason about similarity of time series and cluster them? How does one deal with “dimensionality curse”?",

https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/programs/business-masters/academics/business-analytics,Decision Analytics,"What makes a decision difficult? Usually, the answer is that the decision requires us to spend scarce resources. A “resource” is any asset that can be leveraged to achieve business objectives: time, money, staff, trucks, computer cores, and research effort can all be viewed as resources. When you decide to spend your resource on something (e.g., investing into a research project, or accepting a delivery job), there is less of the resource that can be spent on something else. You thus have to think carefully about the tradeoffs involved in allocating resources to one objective as opposed to another.

This class develops a quantitative framework for studying resource allocation problems. Resource allocation problems arise in many industries and areas such as transportation, electronics, advertising, finance, and health care. The specifics of each problem are very different. Nonetheless, all resource allocation problems, in all of these areas, have common elements that behave in exactly the same way.

Huge amount of data is being generated. At the same time, much of the big data is unstructured, in real time and only loosely connected. It defies the traditional ways of managing databases. This creates challenges even to tech-savvy companies on how to leverage big data to gain competitive advantages. Challenges and opportunities coexist. To extract the great value from the data, we should be equipped with advanced techniques. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is penetrating our daily routines deeply, and shows great promise in exciting areas such as healthcare and autonomous driving cars. 

This course uses a hands-on, learning-by-doing approach to understanding the concepts behind Big Data and AI, the strategic drivers of these technologies and the value propositions that they provide to industries.
