The explosive growth of data coupled with the increasing demands on data management systems has made effective data engineering a necessity for several diverse domains such as healthcare, fundamental sciences, data intensive technology, business and finance. Given the increasing complexity of data, the need for efficient data engineering techniques for mining useful (pertinent) information from the data is paramount. Information is now regarded as an asset, which facilitates decision-making processes in any organization, thereby saving the organization both time as well as money. Consequently, there is an increasing industry demand for specialized professionals in the area of Data Engineering. The current chasm between the number of opportunities and available resources in the domain of data science and analytics is undeniable. Currently, very few institutions offer data science as degree programme that span two years including almost one year research exposure in this field. Data science is concerned with the acquisition, storage, retrieval, processing and finally the conversion of data into knowledge where the quantum of data is very large. Data Science heavily uses the more continuous aspects of mathematics together with considerable statistics. It is different from statistics insofar as there is an intense concentration on efficient algorithms to handle very large data sets, in some cases streamed data, and their realization via different architectures and platforms. Saying so, IIIT- Allahabad is having a pool of domain experts in the said above subject areas. Other disciplines that intensively use data science are the physical sciences (Physics, Astronomy, Biology, and Chemistry), Management, Economics and Finance, and Medicine.
