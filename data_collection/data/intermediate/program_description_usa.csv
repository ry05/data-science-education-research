https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/data-science-masters-program.html,"Data Science is often viewed as the confluence of (1) Computer and Information Sciences (2) Statistical Sciences, and (3) Domain Expertise. These three pillars are not symmetric: the first two together represent the core methodologies and the techniques used in Data Science, while the third pillar is the application domain to which this methodology is applied. In this program, core data science training is focused on the first two pillars, along with practice in applying their skills to address problems in application domains.

We characterize the required Data Science skills in two categories: statistical skills, such as those taught by the Statistics and Biostatistics departments, and computational skills, such as those taught by the Computer Science and Engineering Division and the School of Information. The design of the program is to require every student to receive balanced training in both areas. To create an academic plan that achieves this balance, and to foster a greater sense of shared community, we do not intend to offer any sub-plans or tracks within the proposed degree program. Rather, we will expect graduates of this program to understand data representation and analysis at an advanced level. 

With the MS in Data Science all students will be able to: identify relevant datasets, apply the appropriate statistical and computational tools to the dataset to answer questions posed by individuals, organizations or governmental agencies, design and evaluate analytical procedures appropriate to the data, and implement these efficiently over large heterogeneous data sets in a multi-computer environment."

Students will supplement this work with two courses in a cognate field, a Rackham Graduate School requirement. The specific courses a student will take are determined through discussion with the student's faculty adviser. Flexibility in cognate election is allowed, although each Masters degree candidate must complete specific required courses. In addition, students will participate in practical training which includes coursework and a summer internship.

All students must have satisfactory background, in statistical methods. For students not taking the Statistics track, there is a required three-course sequence taught by MPSDS faculty and tailored to the skills required for a career in survey and data science. In addition, all students will gain familiarity with principles of Data Science from a required course in computing and data display that focuses on machine learning. 
The data science area of concentration is designed for students who wish to specialize in the more computational aspects of survey methodology and research involving ""big data,"" including data visualization, management and analysis of large and messy data sets, human-computer interaction in survey research, and machine learning algorithms."
